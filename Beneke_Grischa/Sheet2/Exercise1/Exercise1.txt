What do you observe?

local:
Only slight wiggle of the polymer

reptation:
Only ends change

pivot:
Polymer is not recognizable after only few moves


Which move is the most effective to generate uncorrelated configurations?
pivot, as it changes the appearance of the polymer most in few steps


Why are some frames of your trajectory identical to the previous?
With my simulation I dont see identical trajectories, but I also do 10 steps before saving another trajectory.
In principle there should always be a finite chance to get back to your original state because of detailed balance.

When comparing different energies you can see that at lower temperature the polymer changes less during steps.
