In 1a only slightly different states are generated at one end of the polymer.
In 1b the reptation elements are moved from the one end to the other of the polymer.
The majority of the polymer stays unchanged for local and reptation moves.
In 1c a completly new uncorrelated configuration is created by the pivot moves.

Therefore, pivot moves are the most effective moves to create uncorrelated new configurations.

Sometimes there are no changes in some frames due to the fact that a step ends in an unvalid configureation.
In this the case, the frame is unrolled to the previous state.
